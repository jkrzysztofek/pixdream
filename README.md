# Project Title

This project is based on tutorial from John Elder's book: "Learn Ruby on Rails For Web Development" and I am going to make it look like Pinterest.com ;)

## Getting Started

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 2.3.3

* Rails version 5.1.6

* Database initialization: run rake db:migrate

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* Ruby version 2.3.3

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
